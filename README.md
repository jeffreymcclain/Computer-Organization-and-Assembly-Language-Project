CSUEB, Computer Organization and Assembly Language

For my final project, I created a functional checkers game written entirely in Assembly language. It can be played with 0-2 players (human vs human, human vs computer, computer vs computer). The program enforces the rules of checkers, and the computer player uses a basic algorithm to determine the optimal move (though it also programmed to occasionally make a sub-optimal move, so it is beatable).
